# Marcoboard
 This is going to be my first deep delve into keyboard design. I am going to be creating most of this myself using ai03 PCB design guides and other guides that will help me along the way. This would be much simpler if I could use a pro micro and socket it onto the board but I need a total of 27 usable pins, along with it being a DIP package as I suck at soldering surface mount chips.
 The keyboard itself will be a 65% keyboard that will utilise 2 rotary encoders, with push switches, along with an OLED screen inbetween them so that you can easily tell which layer you are on. 
 RGB lighting may also be included if I can figure it out but it isn't exactly necessary. I may only create a capslock light for it.
